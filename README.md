It's not much right now, but it will hopefully eventually be a comprehensive way to view and visualise past
Australian elections via a map and pretty colours, with some added statistics.

Here's how it looks right now (2022 election):

Each colour corresponds to a party.
- Pale red is ALP (Australian Labor Party)
- Blue is LP / LNP (Liberal Party, or in Queensland, the Liberal National Party (QLD))
- Dark green is NP (National Party)
- Green is GRN (The Greens) (you can see them in Melbourne and surrounding suburbs of Brisbane)
- and there are also some others...

Specifically, the colour of each electorate (the seat) is indicative of the party that won the seat in the 2022
Australian federal election (to represent the electorate in the House of Representatives).
